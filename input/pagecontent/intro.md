This specification defines the artifacts that are needed to pinpoint the geographical location of FHIR systems, and more precisely certain FHIR capabilities. 

These artifacts should be provided when a site wishes to report its capabilities (not necessarily technically exposing the server, just notifying others of the implementation of the services).
Using these artifacts, organizations that monitor the implementation of standardization efforts can roll out visualizations such as the one in the picture below:

![BE FHIR map](be_map.png "Map")
